# Versed
File conversion can be a pain. Especially when you're trying to automate it. That's why I created Versed, a microservice specifically for that purpose.

Versed exposes a web API for converting files, and also comes with a simple web frontend for manual file conversion.

It's currently powered by LibreOffice and FFmpeg, which means it supports the same file formats that those tools support, but you can easily add more tools to its arsenal.
